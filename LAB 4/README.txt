For executing our last lab first run the create_final_project.sql in MySQL in order to create the database and tables used in the lab.

Then, run insert_final_project.sql, for creating some users, tweets and an admin and being able to see them from the first moment.

After that import the lab_4_final_.war in eclipse and run the main controller. From there you can just test the different features as register, login, add tweets, like and retweet tweets, see the people and the rest of basic features which we will explain in more detail during our presentation
